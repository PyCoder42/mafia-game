# How to Play Mafia

A social deduction game where the Town tries to find the Mafia before it's too late.

## The Basics

You're in a group. Most of you are innocent **Townspeople**. But some of you are **Mafia** pretending to be innocent.

- **Town wins** by voting out all the Mafia
- **Mafia wins** when they equal or outnumber the Town

---

## The Roles

### 👤 Villager
Just a regular person trying to survive. You vote, you gather intel, you try not to die.

### 🔪 Mafia
You know who your teammates are. Each night, you choose someone to eliminate. Act innocent during the day. Don't get caught.

### 💉 Doctor
Each morning, you can try to save someone who was attacked. You won't always succeed, but you might keep someone alive.

### 🔍 Detective
You're better at gathering intel than regular villagers. Your snooping is more effective, and you're harder for Mafia to catch.

## How a Round Works

### 1. Role Reveal
Everyone secretly learns their role. Mafia members see who their teammates are.

### 2. Day Phase (Planning)
Everyone chooses:
- **Where to go** that night (each location has a risk level)
- **What to do** there (actions give you intel but may expose you)

You don't see where others are planning to go.

### 3. Night Phase
The Mafia picks their target. They can see who's in their area and what they're doing. Snoopy people are more likely to get caught.

### 4. Morning
- The Doctor (if alive) chooses someone to save
- Deaths are announced
- Everyone learns what intel they gathered

### 5. Discussion
Share what you learned. Accuse people. Defend yourself. Lie if you're Mafia.

### 6. Vote
Majority vote eliminates one player. Their role is revealed.

Then it repeats until someone wins.

## The Intel System

Every action has two numbers:
- **Intel** (0-100%) - How much you might learn
- **Risk** (green/yellow/red) - How dangerous it is

**High intel = high risk.** If you snoop around, you might catch the Mafia... or they might catch you.

### What affects your risk:
- Your location's base risk level
- The action you choose
- Whether you lock your door or leave it open to listen
- Whether Mafia is in your area

### What you can learn:
- Who was in your location
- Suspicious activity
- Sometimes who the killer is (if you're lucky/skilled)

Detectives get better intel. Mafia sees everything in their area.

---

## Locations

Each story setting has different locations with different risk levels:

- **Low risk** - Safer, but less to learn
- **Medium risk** - Balanced
- **High risk** - Dangerous, but more intel opportunities

Some locations let you lock your door. Locked = safer but less intel. Unlocked = you can listen, but you're exposed.

## Tips

- **As Town:** Share your intel, but be careful who you trust
- **As Mafia:** Blend in, point fingers at others, don't be too quiet or too loud
- **As Doctor:** Save people who seem important, or save yourself
- **As Detective:** Use your intel advantage, but you're still a target

The best part of Mafia is the social chaos. Lie. Accuse. Trust no one. Have fun.
